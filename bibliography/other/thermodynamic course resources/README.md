# Introductory Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics Resources

This folder contains the resources of a thermodynamic book written by _J.Richard Elliott, Carl T. Lira_ that have been 
very useful in the debugging of this code.

The resources are freely downloadable 
from [here](https://learncheme.com/screencasts/thermodynamics/)

The same link contains also some interesting [YouTube tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4xAk5aclnUjeRz26fds2w1Mw8YvKHuSU)
on the usage of the program contained in this folder.
