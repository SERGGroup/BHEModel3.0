The examples were rearranged for the Spring '11 printing, but
we failed to renumber the Matlab example files. The examples are
placed in corresponding chapter folders, and the file names agree with
the references given in the text. However, the names of the files
do not agree with the actual example numbers in the text. This will
be fixed in the published edition.
